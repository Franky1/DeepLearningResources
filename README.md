## Prerequisites to Understand Deep Learning In-Depth

Deep learning techniques rely mostly on fundamental linear algebra, a bit of optimization and common machine learning algorithms. Additionally, if you want to apply them in practice, knowing python is invaluable. You can skip these if you feel comfortable with these topics or want to dive in directly. Additionally, many lectures and books provide condensed introductions to these topics.

### The Math

* [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra â€“ Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/) **[Book]**
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) **[Book]**

### Machine Learning

* [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) **[Book]**

### Python

* **[NEEDED]**

### Task specific knowledge

Depending on the task that you want to work on, some background on what the data for that task typically looks like might be useful.

#### Image data

* Introduction to RGB data etc **[NEEDED]**
* Introductions to CT/X-Ray/MRI? **[NEEDED]**

#### Sequential / Audio data

* Audio / Time-series introduction? **[NEEDED]**
