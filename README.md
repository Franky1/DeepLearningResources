## Prerequisites to Understand Deep Learning In-Depth

Deep learning techniques rely mostly on fundamental linear algebra, a bit of optimization and common machine learning algorithms. Additionally, if you want to apply them in practice, knowing python is invaluable. You can skip these if you feel comfortable with these topics or want to dive in directly. Additionally, many lectures and books provide condensed introductions to these topics.
