# Deep Learning Resources
This document provides a general overview of useful resources to get started with deep learning. Feel free to suggest additional ones.

The following information is provided for each resource:
* Type - e.g. Video, Lecture, Book, Webpage, Academic Paper
* Utilized framework - e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, FastAI, MXNet
* Date 
* Language
## Prerequesites to understand deep learning
Deep learning techniques rely mostly on fundamental linear algebra, a bit of optimization and common machine learning algorithms. Additionally, if you want to apply them in practice, knowing python is invaluable. 
### The Math
#### Linear Algebra
* Matrix operations
* Convolutions
* Tensor arithmetics
#### Optimization
* Iterative optimization algorithms
* Stochastic gradient descent
### Machine Learning
* Classical AI/ML (Perceptron), Crossfold validation, Softmax 
### Python
* Books, videos, interactive
### Task specific knowledge
Depending on the task you want to work on, some background on what the data for that task typically looks like might be useful.
#### Image data
* RGB, (0,255) etc
* CT/X-Ray/MRI?
#### Sequential / Audio data
* Audio
* Time-series
## Getting started with deep learning
By now, there is a multitude of learning resources for deep learning out there. Some highly-recommended ones are provided here, however personal preference might lead you to others.
* FastAI
* cs231n
* Andrew NG
* ML 100 pages book
* Book by Goodfellow?
* Practical stuff?
